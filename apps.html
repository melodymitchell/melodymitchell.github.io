        <h1>CSC Final Project Page</h1>
        <p id = "appsintro"> This page is where you can view and interact with the program my partner, Larry Khun, and I created for the final project of the CSC106 class at the University of Rhode Island.
        <br>Our program was created in Khan Academy's Javascript and ProcessingJS programming environment. The program is an interactive storybook about picking out and decorating <br> a christmas tree.
        As a user, you are able to choose the size of tree you want, the category of decorations, and place each ornament wherever you would like on the tree. In certain <br>
        scenes, there is even animation to give the illusion of snow falling!
        To use the program, click the start button and then follow along with the story, using the next buttons to move <br>
        through the story. On scenes where you can choose things, you must click one of those buttons before the next button will appear. <br>
        Try it out below!</p>
